# Trayplay
With Trayplay you can control you music with media control buttons, which are added with this simple utility.

It is a portable program that does not require installation of additional components. Each button works like a separate application.

In the settings, you can turn off the button you don't need. There is also a dark theme for compatibility with the light theme of Windows.

You can buy me a cookie or beer :D [![paypal](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/626091011961126937/863023649401077780/donate.png)](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=6USHZW32P5SXE)
